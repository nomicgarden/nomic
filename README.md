# Nomic

Welcome to the garden!

## What is Nomic?

Nomic is a game invented by philosopher Peter Suber. The primary characteristic of Nomic is that the rules of the game can be changed by the players as part of the gameplay. Players vote on rule changes, and these changes become part of the game itself. This creates a dynamic and evolving game system where strategy involves not only playing by the current rules but also shaping the rules to one's advantage.

## What are Prediction Markets?

Prediction markets are platforms where users can bet on the outcomes of future events. These markets aggregate collective knowledge and beliefs to forecast future happenings. Participants buy and sell shares in contracts that pay out based on the results of these events.
Manifold Markets is a popular example of a prediction market platform where users can create and participate in markets on a wide variety of topics.

## What is Nomic Garden?

Nomic Garden is an experimental organization that operates as a game of Nomic. It uniquely combines the rule-making dynamics of Nomic with the forecasting power of prediction markets.
In Nomic Garden, the rules of the organization itself are subject to change, proposed and decided upon by its members. The decision-making process incorporates elements of:
- **Futarchy**: Prediction markets are used to forecast the likely outcomes of proposed rule changes. The results of these markets heavily influence whether a proposal is adopted, prioritizing changes that are predicted to be beneficial.
- **Democracy**: Members also have direct voting rights on proposals, ensuring a balance between market-driven insights and collective will.

This structure aims to create a resilient and adaptable organization where governance evolves based on collective intelligence and foresight.
